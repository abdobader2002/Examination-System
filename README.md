# Examination‑System

A simple examination system to manage and administer exams and related data (database files, mappings, scripts, etc.).

## 🚀 Overview

The Examination‑System project provides a straightforward way to organize exam-related data, mappings, and scripts — including database schemas, ER diagrams, SQL scripts, and utility scripts — to support building or managing an exam system.  
It’s useful for academic institutions, instructors, or developers who want a base structure to build on or customize for managing examinations.

## 📁 Repository Structure

```
/Database Files            — contains database backups or database-related scripts  
/ERD&Mapping               — ER diagrams and data model mapping files  
/all Scripts and Names     — all relevant source/scripts (e.g. SQL, application logic, import/export, etc.)  
Description.docx           — project description / requirements documentation  
SQL Server Project Requirements sheet.pdf — requirements/specs sheet  
accounts.txt               — example or template accounts file  
```

> **Note:** Adjust folder names if you rename or reorganize later.

## ✨ Features / What it Provides

- Database schema files and mappings  
- ER diagrams / model design files  
- Collection of scripts for database operations or exam management tasks  
- Documentation (requirements & project description) to guide setup or customization  

## 📥 Getting Started / Setup

1. Clone the repository  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/abdobader2002/Examination-System.git
   ```  
2. Open the database project / files under `Database Files` in your preferred SQL Server environment (or adapt to your DBMS).  
3. Review the ERD & mapping under `ERD&Mapping` to understand the data model.  
4. Use or adapt the scripts under `all Scripts and Names` for your exam data import/export or management needs.  
5. Consult `Description.docx` and requirements sheet (`SQL Server Project Requirements sheet.pdf`) for details about structure, purpose, and required setup.

## 🧑‍💻 Usage

- Use this repository as a starting point for building a custom exam management system.  
- Import database schema and data into your database server to initialize structure.  
- Customize or extend scripts according to your application logic (e.g., exam creation, student management, grades).  
- Use or adapt the documentation files to plan and implement features relevant to your context (school, university, training center, etc.).
